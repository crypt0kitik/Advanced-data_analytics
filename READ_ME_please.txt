Evaluating dataset quality

Goal: Evaluate the quality of datasets.

In this project, I have two datasets. I started with the classification dataset, which is about IMDb movie ratings. For this dataset, I tested the following tools:
- Autoviz
- Dataprep
- LIME
- Phik-matrix
- Sweetviz
- Ydata

After that, I performed the same operations on the regression dataset, with additional tests:
- Seaborn polynomial test
- MAD test

Regression Dataset:
The target variable is a continuous value, which is the movie rating.

Classification Dataset:
The target variable is a classification target with two options: whether a loan is taken (yes/no).
