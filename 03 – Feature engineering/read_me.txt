03 â€“ Feature engineering

I have included three separate reports with screenshots 
to provide you with the same perspective I have 
and to ensure smooth functionality without any crashes.

Classification dataset - bank
01 - SelectKBest, Fisher score & RFE - comparison
01 - Correlation matrix & phik-matrix - comparison
02 - Multiplicative interactions & Ratio features - comparison
03 - Redundancy management and dimensionality reduction 
04 - High cardinality management: Target encoding 
04 - High cardinality management: Feature hashing 
04 - High cardinality management: Grouping rare categories together


Regression dataset - movies
01 - Mutual Information & SHAP, LIME: very good insights
02 - Additive interactions & Categorical interactions
03 - Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) --working on this now
04 - High cardinality management: Frequency encoding
04 - High cardinality management: CategoryEncoders
05 - Cluster profiling
